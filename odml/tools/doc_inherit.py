"""
This is a working hack to provide inherited docstrings.
The only other working way I tried would involve metaclasses.

Each method to inherit a docstring is flagged using the @inherit_docstring
decorator.

The actual inheritance is done in the class decorator @allow_inherit_docstring,
which uses the classes base-classes and its mro and copies the first docstring
it finds.
