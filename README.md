odML libraries and editor
=========================

Installation
------------

To install the package simply run:

    $ sudo python setup.py install --prefix /usr

If you just want to try out, tell python where to find the library
and start either the gui or a python shell:

    $ PYTHONPATH=. ./odml-gui
    $ PYTHONPATH=. python

### Debian / Ubuntu

Two debian packages are created:
    * python-odml containing only the odml-library (API)
    * python-odml-gui providing the additional gui-specific parts

To build the packages run:

    git checkout debian
    cd debian; make; cd ..
    fakeroot debian/rules binary

And install them:

    dpkg -i ../python-odml*.deb

### Windows

A windows package is seperately bundled.
To build the windows package from source, follow these instructions:

1. Install the following software (ALWAYS use the 32-bit versions!)
    * [python-2.7](http://www.python.org/getit/windows/)
    * [pygtk-windows](http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html) (all-in-one installer)
    * [py2exe](http://sourceforge.net/projects/py2exe/files/py2exe/0.6.9/py2exe-0.6.9.win32-py2.7.exe/download)
    * [setuptools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#files)

2. Install build dependencies

   `$ easy_install.exe lxml`

   If this fails, you can fall back to installing it from the 
   [Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml)

3. To just run the software use:

   `$ python.exe odml-gui`

   You may also rename odml-gui to odml-gui.py, which allows you to start
   the gui through double clicking on that file. You can even right click and
   send it as a shortcut to the desktop.

4. Compile a binary for redistribution

   `$ python.exe setup.py py2exe`

   For some reason the compiled binary has a different look, so running
   the software from source gets a more native look.

   The provided standalone package is created on linux using the `gen-win32-package.sh`
   script on the win32 branch. It requires wine though for extraction of msi-installers.
